			<h1>CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations</h1>
					<h2>1. Starter Code</h2>
				<p>Welcome everyone. Before we begin, please check Slack for the starter code. Open the files on your computer and give us a heads-up once you’re ready. This code will be our foundation as we go through the demos later.</p>

				<h3>2. CSS vs. JavaScript Animations</h3>
			</header>
			<p>In this slide, we compare CSS and JavaScript animations. CSS animations are great for simple, straightforward effects—they’re easy to implement and maintain. In contrast, JavaScript animations offer greater control and flexibility, which is useful for more complex or dynamic scenarios. Later, I’ll show you an example that highlights these differences in action.</p>

			<h3>3. Basic Animation Properties</h3>

		<p>Let’s start with the basic properties of CSS animations. The 'animation-name' property links an element to a set of @keyframes that define the animation sequence. Meanwhile, 'animation-duration' specifies how long one cycle of the animation takes to complete. These two properties form the core of any CSS animation.</p>
	</section>

		<h3>4. Repetition & Direction</h3>
	<p>Now, we’ll discuss how to control the repetition and direction of animations. 'Animation-iteration-count' lets you set how many times an animation should play—this can be a specific number or infinite. 'Animation-direction' determines whether the animation plays normally, in reverse, or alternates between the two. Finally, 'animation-fill-mode' controls the state of the element before and after the animation runs, ensuring a smooth visual transition.</p>

		<h3>5. Timing Properties</h3>

	<p>Next are the timing properties. 'Animation-delay' sets a pause before the animation starts,
		 and interestingly, it can even be negative, so the animation begins partway through its
		  cycle. 'Animation-timing-function' lets you define the speed curve of the animation, like easing in or out, which affects how the animation feels. 'Animation-play-state' is useful for pausing and resuming the animation as needed. Understanding these gives you fine control over how and when your animations play.</p>

		<h3>6.The 'animation' Shorthand</h3>

	<p>This slide introduces the 'animation' shorthand property. Instead of writing out each 
		individual property, you can bundle them into a single line. This not only simplifies 
		your CSS but also makes it easier to maintain. For those who want more detail, I’ve 
		included a link to the MDN documentation on CSS animations.</p>

		<h3>7.Accessibility Considerations</h3>
	
	<p>Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design. With animations, it’s important to 
		consider users who may experience discomfort from excessive motion. Best practices 
		include providing a ‘reduce motion’ option and ensuring that animations are subtle 
		and not too distracting. This approach helps make your website more inclusive and 
		user-friendly.</p>

		<h3>8.Real-World Examples</h3>
	<p>Finally, let’s look at some real-world examples of CSS animations. On this slide, 
		you’ll see screenshots and brief notes on how popular websites implement CSS animations to enhance user experience. Take note of how these sites balance motion with usability—this can provide great inspiration for your own projects. In our demo, we’ll also inspect some live examples to see these techniques in action.</p>
